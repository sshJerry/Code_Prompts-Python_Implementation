/*
You are given a List<String> and you need to implement two methods:

* encode(strs): This method takes a list of strings and returns a single, encoded string.
* decode(s): This method takes an encoded string and returns the original list of strings.

Your algorithm must be able to handle any possible character and should
 not rely on any pre-built serialization methods.
 The encoded string should be able to be passed over a network.

Example 1:
Input: ["Hello", "World"]
Encoded Output: "5#Hello5#World"
Decoded Output: ["Hello", "World"]

Example 2:
Input: ["", ""]
Encoded Output: "0#0#"
Decoded Output: ["", ""]

Constraints:
0 <= strs.length <= 1000
0 <= strs[i].length <= 1000
strs[i] may contain any of the 256 valid ASCII characters.
